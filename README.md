This project is a simple Flask web application that provides an API for a datastore-backed key-value store with undo and redo capabilities. It allows users to perform various operations on the datastore, such as setting and unsetting key-value pairs, retrieving the value of a key, and counting the number of keys with a specific value. The application utilizes Google Cloud Datastore for storage and maintains a stack of performed operations to enable undo and redo functionality.

Main features:
1. Set and unset key-value pairs.
2. Retrieve the value of a key.
3. Count the number of keys with a specific value.
4. Undo and redo previous operations.
5. End a session and clean up the datastore.

The application can be deployed on Google App Engine and provides a RESTful API for interacting with the datastore.
